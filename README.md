APS105 Labs-- C programming

The code corresponds for the labs of APS105，2012 Fall， University of Toronto.

All the codes in this repository is created in Augest, 2017 since I want to practice programming again.

The lab has been changed a lot these years. So it probably won't be useful for others. It is just for self-practice purpose.
